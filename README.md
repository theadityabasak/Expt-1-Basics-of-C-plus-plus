# Expt 1: Basics of C++
# App used: VS Code
# Theory
C++ is a general-purpose, high-performance programming language that builds on the foundation of the C language. Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Labs, C++ is a cross-platform language used to create high-performance applications. It supports object-oriented programming, making it a versatile tool for various types of software development.

This experiment consists of two practicals namely printing of "Hello World" and making of calculator program.
# Program 1
In the hello world program , the cout function from the iostream library is commonly used to print output to the console. The iostream library in C++ is a part of the Standard Library and provides functionalities for input and output operations.The using namespace std; directive is used to avoid the need to prefix standard library names with std::.
# Program 2
Basic airthmetic operations(+,-,/,*) were used to create the calculator program. While cin function is used to recive inputs from the user.
# Conclusuion
we learned the basic of c plus plus
